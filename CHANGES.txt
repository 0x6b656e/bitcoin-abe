New in 0.4.1 - 2011-08-16
=========================

* Security enhancement: refer to orphan blocks by hash, not height.

* Fixed bugs affecting new chains defined via the configuration.

* Warn, do not exit, if a block file is missing or unparsable.

* Abe parses the new merged-mining block field, CAuxPow.

* Decrement the value returned by getblockcount for compatibility.

* Bug fix: remove '-' from parenthesized amounts.

* Fixed previous/next block links on /chain/CHAIN/b/NUMBER pages.

* Accept "var += val" in configuration as equivalent to "var = val"
  where "var" has not been defined.

* Added --commit-bytes option to adjust the database commit interval.

* Minor robustness and cosmetic improvements.


Major changes from 0.3 to 0.4 (2011-07-04 to 2011-07-15)
========================================================

* The chain summary page (the one listing several blocks in the same
  chain) loads much faster than before.

* Address search accepts an initial substring, still without storing
  addresses in the database.

* FastCGI support has matured.  See README-FASTCGI.txt for setup.

* Abe supports Weeds currency natively.  Weeds info:
  http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=24209.0

* The "datadir" configuration directive can add a new currency without
  changes to Python code.

* "auto-agpl" provides a link to download the source directory: a
  license compliance aid for those not wishing to use a Github fork.

* /chain/Bitcoin/q/getblockcount: first of (I hope) many
  BBE-compatible APIs.

* Several small fixes and speedups.
