Major changes from 0.3 to 0.4 (2011-07-04 to 2011-07-15)
========================================================

* The chain summary page (the one listing several blocks in the same
  chain) loads much faster than before.

* Address search accepts an initial substring, still without storing
  addresses in the database.

* FastCGI support has matured.  See README-FASTCGI.txt for setup.

* Abe supports Weeds currency natively.  Weeds info:
  http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=24209.0

* The "datadir" configuration directive can add a new currency without
  changes to Python code.

* "auto-agpl" provides a link to download the source directory: a
  license compliance aid for those not wishing to use a Github fork.

* /chain/Bitcoin/q/getblockcount: first of (I hope) many
  BBE-compatible APIs.

* Several small fixes and speedups.
